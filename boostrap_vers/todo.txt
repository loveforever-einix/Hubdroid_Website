TODO LIST


Design part (From LoveForEver's point of view = estetic):
* Maybe change color panel of site?
* Change fonts to android's one ?

==> index.html
* Remove/Hide clients part of home (maybe replace with sponsors or partner later) ?
* Change "city" background on index.html to something more Android
* Keep latest work structure (pictures) and replace it with Rom Names (Miui, CM, PA, Omni, Carbon, etc)?

    => Will creat a index2.html to show you my thinking so you can agree or not (LoveForEver)

==> Menu
* Integrate "Rom" dropdown-menu in the nav bar
* Put Blog in nav bar and maybe delete single-post (utility?)




Devlopement (and design also) part:

* Create builders panel:
  * Build Calendar
  * Build job creator
  * Some commands to clean work dir
  * Final build management system to publish to the web the builds (public panel or host files providers) 
* Create admin panel (for Info4Geek & percy_g2)
  * All like builders
  * Users management
  * Quota management
  * Server ressources monitoring
  * Some commands
* Create public part:
  * Users can see ROMs and Kernel organized by builders usernames or groups on the homepage
    * After selecting the ROM, the device and the build who user want to download, an download page appears with:
      * File name
      * By who ?
      * MD5
      * Number of download
      * Download button
  * Textual informations for users (with donation buttons and more)
  * Contact tab


=> Give me work and i will do it 
=> Maybe we should organize the task between us
