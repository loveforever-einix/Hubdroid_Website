TODO LIST


Design part (From LoveForEver's point of view = estetic):
* Maybe change color panel of site?
* Change fonts to android's one ?

==> index.html
* Remove/Hide clients part of home (maybe replace with sponsors or partner later) ?
* Change "city" background on index.html to something more Android
* Keep latest work structure (pictures) and replace it with Rom Names (Miui, CM, PA, Omni, Carbon, etc)?

    => Will creat a index2.html to show you my thinking so you can agree or not (LoveForEver)

==> Menu
* Integrate "Rom" dropdown-menu in the nav bar
* Put Blog in nav bar and maybe delete single-post (utility?)




Devlopement (and design also) part:

* Create builders panel:
  * Build Calendar
  * Build job creator
  * Some commands to clean work dir
  * Final build management system to publish to the web the builds (public panel or host files providers) 

* Create admin panel (for Info4Geek & percy_g2)
  * All like builders
  * Users management: add/edit/remove user, modify rank (0: banned, 1: member, 2: builder, 3: admin 4: owner)
  * Quota management
  * Server ressources monitoring
  * Some commands

* Create public part:
  * Users can see ROMs and Kernel organized by builders usernames or groups on the homepage
    * After selecting the ROM, the device and the build who user want to download, an download page appears with:
      * File name
      * By who ?
      * MD5
      * Number of download
      * Download button
  * Textual informations for users (with donation buttons and more)
  * Contact tab


=> Give me work and i will do it 
=> Maybe we should organize the task between us

Important things will have to do before starting dev part : 
 * Move the header part in includes/header.php and footer to includes/footer.php. It will be cool because if we have to chance something on the header, it will change that thing on all pages!
 * Create a config.php file to store all database connection data. We include it in each page if we need access to the database.
 * Establishing a MCD (a MySQL tables diagram) to see what tables we need, and if we use relations, what relation we need. I will publish a first diagram soon, feel free to give me your ideas.
