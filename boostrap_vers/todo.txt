=> Give me work and i will do it 
=> Maybe we should organize the task between us

Important things will have to do before starting dev part : 
 * Move the header part in includes/header.php and footer to includes/footer.php. It will be cool because if we have to chance something on the header, it will change that thing on all pages! 

	=> header and footer are now okay. I may change css later but won't touch code anymore so you can start your integration in includes folder 

 * Create a config.php file to store all database connection data. We include it in each page if we need access to the database.
 * Establishing a MCD (a MySQL tables diagram) to see what tables we need, and if we use relations, what relation we need. I will publish a first diagram soon, feel free to give me your ideas.
